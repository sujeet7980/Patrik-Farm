            <li>As per Indian Horticulture Database (2005), fruit crops cover an area of 4.96 m ha. and vegetables crops 6.75 m.ha.. Accordingly, 
                49.29 m.ton of fruits and 101.43 m ton of vegetables are produced in the country annually. To meet out the projected demand of 
                population by 2020 A.D, about 50 m.ton of fruits and 143 m. ton of vegetables would be required. Therefore by 2020 A.D. the 
                production of fruits needs to be increased. Requirements of export and processing industry further add to the requirements of
                 horticultural produce. In view of these, there is lot of scope of increasing production and potentiality of horticulture crops.</li>
            <li>Apart from fruits and vegetables, floriculture industry in India comprising of florist trade, nursery plants, potted plants, seed 
                and bulb products is being observed as sunrise industry. There is soaring business of flowers in almost all metropolitan cities of 
                the different states. The developed flower market in the country during 2005 is with area of 2.24 lakh ha with a production of 6.54
                 lakh MT loose flowers and 19515 lakh cut flowers. The traditional flowers are grown on a large hectare of land on a commercial 
                 scale. These flowers are mostly grown for loose flower purpose. Area under cut flowers like rose, chrysanthemum, gladiolus, 
                 carnation and orchids is increasing day by day.</li>
           <li>Plantation crops are another potential sector with lot of opportunities of employment generation, foreign exchange earnings and overall
                supporting livelihood sustenance of mankind at large. These crops form the mainstay of lives especially in coastal areas of the
                 country where predominating stands of plantation crops are found. Coconut has so much importance in the country that the state
                  Kerala receives its very name on the basis of coconut, the Malayalam name of which is Kera.. These cover an area of 31.02 lakh 
                  ha with a production of 131.60 lakh MT.</li>
